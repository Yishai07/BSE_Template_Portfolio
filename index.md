# Retropie Game Emulator
I am working on a game emulator using Retropie with custom controllers.

# Final Milestone
My third and final milestone is creating my own custom controller. I had to learn how to code and use an arduino, as I had never done either of those things before. I also had to learn how to solder, because all of the buttons on my controller required me to solder them onto a proto board, which I had also never done before. I had never wired anything either, so I had a lot of researching and learning that I had to do before I could even start. What I hadn't realized was that I needed a specific type of Arduino for my controller, so I accidentally ordered the wrong one. It took a while to order a new one and wait for it to arrive, so I couldn't wire everything together for a few days. In the end though, it wasn't a big loss, as I used the time to code and finish everything, and I ended up with a fully functioning controller! I was originally going to make it wireless, but I ran out of time, so I will attempt it on my own. Below I included a picture of the controller and a snippet of the code.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is adding a game to my Retropie. First, not knowing I had a USB to use, I tried to connect through a downloadable app on the computer, but that didn't work. Later, realizing there was a USB I could use, I created a file on the USB titled "retropie". Then, I plugged it into the Retropie for 30 seconds, and then removed it and plugged the USB back into the computer. Then, I moved the previously downloaded games into the files with the same name as their original console, generated by the Retropie, and ejected the USB. Finally, I put it back into the Retropie, waited until all of it had downloaded, took out the USB, and restarted the Retropie. When it reloaded, the games were inside and playable.

# First Milestone
My first milestone is setting up the Retropie and hooking everything up to it, like the keyboard, mouse, and pre-made controllers, along with getting the wifi and the internet working. Unlike the usual, I downloaded Retropie instead of Raspberry Pi, since Retropie is better for games. I had to download an imager so I could get the Retropie onto my Raspberry Pi's SD card, and that took a while, because it didn't work on the computer I normally used. I had to use a seperate computer, which was a VERY slow process. After downloading Retropie onto my SD card, which I inserted into the computer, I stuck it into my Raspberry Pi, hooked up the monitor, keyboard and mouse, and controllers, and booted it up. After that, I connected the Retropie to Wifi and the internet, and it was working.
