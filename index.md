# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was adding a game to my Retropie. First, not knowing I had a USB to use, I tried to connect through

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the Retropie and hooking up everything to it, like the keyboard, mouse, and pre-made controllers, along with hooking it up to wifi and the internet. Unlike the usual, I downloaded Retropie instead of Raspberry Pi, since Retropie is better for games. I had to download an imager so I could get the Retropie onto my Raspberry Pi's SD card, and that took a while, because it didn't work on the computer I normally used. I had to use a seperate computer, which was a VERY slow process. After downloading Retropie onto my SD card, which I inserted into the computer, I stuck it into my Raspberry Pi, hooked up the monitor, keyboard and mouse, and controllers, and booted it up. After that, I had to connect to Wifif and the internet, and it was working.
