# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is adding a game to my Retropie. First, not knowing I had a USB to use, I tried to connect through a downloadable app on the computer, but that didn't work. Later, realizing there was a USB I could use, I created a file on the USB titled "retropie". Then, I plugged it into the Retropie for 30 seconds, and then removed it and plugged the USB back into the computer. Then, I moved the previously downloaded games into the files with the same name as their original console, generated by the Retropie, and ejected the USB. Finally, I put it back into the Retropie, waited until all of it had downloaded, took out the USB, and restarted the Retropie. When it reloaded, the games were inside and playable.

# First Milestone
My first milestone is setting up the Retropie and hooking everything up to it, like the keyboard, mouse, and pre-made controllers, along with getting the wifi and the internet working. Unlike the usual, I downloaded Retropie instead of Raspberry Pi, since Retropie is better for games. I had to download an imager so I could get the Retropie onto my Raspberry Pi's SD card, and that took a while, because it didn't work on the computer I normally used. I had to use a seperate computer, which was a VERY slow process. After downloading Retropie onto my SD card, which I inserted into the computer, I stuck it into my Raspberry Pi, hooked up the monitor, keyboard and mouse, and controllers, and booted it up. After that, I connected the Retropie to Wifi and the internet, and it was working.
